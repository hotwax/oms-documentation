This table maps the `DeliveryType` values in the API JSON. 

The `Id` column represents the numeric identifier for each delivery option, and the `Description` column provides a human-readable description of each option.

In the API JSON, the `DeliveryType` field should take one of these values based on the desired delivery method:

- For "Delivery in store" (store pickup) set `DeliveryType` to `1`.
- For "Delivery at Home" set `DeliveryType` to `2`.

| Id   | Description        |
|------|--------------------|
| 1    | Delivery in store  |
| 2    | Delivery at Home   |



This table maps the `PaymentType` values in the API JSON. 
The `Id` column represents the numeric identifier for each payment option, and the `Description` column provides a human-readable description of each option.

In the API JSON, the `PaymentType` field should take one of these values based on the desired payment method:

- For "Credit/Debit Card," set `PaymentType` to `1`.
- For "Cash on delivery," set `PaymentType` to `2`.

So, when constructing the API JSON for an order, you would choose the appropriate `PaymentType` value based on the payment method associated with the order.
| Id   | Description          |
|------|----------------------|
| 1    | Credit/Debit Card    |
| 2    | Cash on delivery     |

During invoicing, HotWax also uses inventory transfers in Retail Pro to ensure inventory is depleted at the actual shipping store as well. Read more about that API on the next page.
