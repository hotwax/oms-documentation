## Receive Shipments

The process of receiving a shipment can be easily managed using Hotwax Commerce's Receiving app using the following steps. 

**1. Locate ASN:**

The first page users see when they log into the app is the `Shipments` page which houses a complete list of ASN receivied from ERP or WMS. To locate specific ASN, store associates can scan the ASN barcode from the physical copy received along with the package. Store associates can also manually input the ASN ID in the `Search` box to locate the shipment.

**2. View ASN Details:**

Once ASN is located, store associates can tap to view the `ASN details` including SKUs along with their names, SKU codes, images, and expected inventory counts.

**3. Locate Items:**

The inbound shipments generally contain multiple product items, store associates can either scan individual product barcodes or search SKUs to locate specific items and start receiving. In case you are not managing barcodes, tap to the `image icon` to see the enlarged to easily identify the product before receiving.

**4. Receive Items:**

If store associates have verified that the physical inventory count matches the anticipated inventory in the ASN, they can tap on the `Receive All` button to accept the entire received inventory at once.

If store associates encounter any discrepancy between the physical count and the anticipated inventory, they can manually input the received quantities. Retailers have the option to mandate store associates to scan the unique barcode of each SKU for enhanced accuracy and inventory management.

When receiving inventory, retailers can also select the pre-defined location in the store where the inventory will be put away. This will help in the picking process as the picker would have easy access to the item during fulfillment.

**5. Save and Finalize:**

Store associates need to tap on the `double checkmarks` at the bottom of the page to conclude the receiving process and update the inventory in the system. The inbound shipments are removed from the page only when inventory for all the products is received.
