## Receive Returns

Retailers who accept return at their stores need to accurately receive and record the returned inventory for potential resale on e-commerce.

Store associates can lookup the incoming returns by navigating to the `Returns` page and identifying the returns with the `Return ID`. Store associates can receive the returned items similarly to the [inbound shipments](receiving.md#receive-asn).\
