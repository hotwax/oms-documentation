# Import Returns

The import returns feature in HotWax Commerce streamlines the return management process for retailers using Shopify. Returns, whether initiated by customers or customer service representatives (CSRs), are a common aspect of eCommerce. Retailers often leverage third-party return management apps to handle returns efficiently. However, HotWax Commerce doesn't function as a Return Management System; instead, it integrates with Shopify to import the returns.

HotWax Commerce downloads return data once the return process is completed in Shopify, and this information is then transmitted to ERP systems for financial and accounting purposes. The integration avoids the need for direct links between ERP and Return Management Systems.

Here's how returns can be imported from Shopify to HotWax Commerce:

1. log in to the `HotWax Commerce Job Manager App` from the `launchpad`.
2. Within the `Job Manager` app, go to the `Orders` page.
3. Locate the `Returns` job within the `import` section of the `Orders` page.
4. Click on the job title to open the job card.
5. Specify the job run time and preferred frequency based on your operational needs.
6. Click on `Save Changes` to schedule the job according to the defined run time and frequency.

Refer to our [Shopify Integration guide](https://docs.hotwax.co/integration-resources/how-does-hotwax-commerce-manage-order-returns/import-returns-from-shopify) for detailed insights into how the `import return` job facilitates the import of order returns from Shopify.
