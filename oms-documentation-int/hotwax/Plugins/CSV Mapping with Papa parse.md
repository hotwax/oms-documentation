# CSV Mapping with Papa Parse

## Overview

The Papa Parse package is an in-browser parser that allows systems to parse CSV data into JSON and vice versa. This package is used by HotWax Commerce apps to map the HotWax CSV format with the external system's CSV format.

## Use Case

### Case 1: Importing Purchase Orders in the Import App

When retailers import purchase orders with the Import App, the predefined fields available in the OMS may not match the field names used in the retailers' external systems that generate the purchase orders. In such cases, the Papa Parse package helps users map the external field names in the purchase order CSV with the field names in the OMS.

## Usage

To use the Papa Parse package, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.papaparse.com/docs) for detailed instructions and customization options. Make sure to check the compatibility of the package version with your application before integration.
