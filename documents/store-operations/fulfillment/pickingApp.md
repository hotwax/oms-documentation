# Picking App

## Picklists

**Filters:** Using filters provides a focused view, highlighting the tasks that still need attention.

* Only show my picklists: Only show picklists associated with the logged-in user. Users can also see a picklist of other users by turning the toggle off to view other team members' picklists within a facility to make collaboration during fulfillment simpler.
* Hide completed picklists: Don't show recently completed picklists.
