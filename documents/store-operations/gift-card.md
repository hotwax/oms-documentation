# Gift Card Activation

HotWax Commerce’s Fulfillment App enables store associates to activate gift cards directly during the order fulfillment process. The Direct Activation feature allows gift cards to be activated in real-time as part of order fulfillment, while Automated Synchronization with Shopify ensures that activation codes are instantly updated, making gift cards redeemable without delays. This process minimizes potential errors and provides a faster experience for both fulfillment teams and customers.

3. **Click the Gift Box Icon**: Select the gift box icon to view the specific gift card details and its associated code.
4. **Add the Gift Card Number**: Enter the gift card number on the activation page.
5. **Click the Save Icon**: After entering the number, click the save icon to complete the activation, ensuring the gift card is immediately usable by the customer.
