# Open Order Tab

All BOPIS orders that have been received and need to be fulfilled are displayed in the `Open` tab on Orders page. Users can also use the `Search` bar on this page to find open orders using customer name, product name, or order ID. The list of orders is available on this page along with some key attributes of the orders.

* **Stock Information:** The stock information of any product in an order can be viewed conveniently by clicking on the `box` icon against the item in the order card, this will display the available inventory of that product at the facility.
* **Order Placed Timeline:** The order card displays the time elapsed since the order was received, allowing store associates to efficiently prioritize the packing and fulfillment of orders in a timely manner.
* **Handling Instruction:** If any handling instructions are mentioned on orders, they are also displayed on the order card so that users can take note of them while picking and packing orders. These can also be viewed on the `Order details` pages and `Packed` orders tab.
* **Ready for Pickup:** Users can use the `Ready for Pickup` button on the order card to mark the packed orders as ready for pickup. A pop-up card will open on clicking the button which allows the users to select the associate who picked and packed the order. Alternatively, orders can be marked ready for pickup from the `Order details` page as well.

### ATP Computation

Store associates require clear visibility into inventory levels for order items to facilitate better decision-making and accurate order fulfillment. For instance, when a customer places a BOPIS order, the store may show a quantity on hand (QOH) of 10 units. However, if the safety stock is also set to 10, store associates must make a choice: they can either fulfill the BOPIS order or retain the items for in-store customers.

In this scenario, the decision ultimately rests with the retailer. They need to assess whether to prioritize fulfilling online orders or ensuring in-store inventory availability. This flexibility allows associates to make informed choices based on current demand and operational needs, enhancing overall inventory management.

When you navigate to the Open Orders page, you’ll see the order with a cube icon. Clicking this icon reveals an i icon, where you can view the real-time inventory details. These include:

* Quantity on Hand
* Safety Stock
* Order Reservations
* Online ATP

This real-time ATP data allows users to see available stocks across different sections, helping to manage orders efficiently.

Incorporating ATP availability into store operations enhances decision-making, improves customer satisfaction, and boosts operational efficiency. This visibility empowers staff to manage inventory better and ensures that orders are fulfilled promptly without stock shortages.
