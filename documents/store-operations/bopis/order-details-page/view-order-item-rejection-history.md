# View Order Item Rejection History

If an item in an order is rejected, it can be viewed in the `Order item rejection history` window.This window can be accessed by clicking on the `clock` icon on the top right corner of the `Order details` page.

If an order with a single item is rejected, it will disappear from the BOPIS app and the rejected item status will be displayed in the Sales Order page of the OMS. And when the item will be re-brokered, the item rejection history will become available in the order item rejection history window.
