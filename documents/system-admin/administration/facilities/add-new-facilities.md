# Add New Facilities

The process of adding a new facility involves the following steps: Navigate to the `Facilities App` in the `Launchpad` and login to access the app.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only users with Admin permissions can log in to the `Facilities app`. Users in the Administration security group have admin permissions.
{% endhint %}

1. Select the `Facilities` option on the homepage to view all the existing facilities.
2. To create a new facility users need to click on the `+` button at the bottom right corner and then select the type of facility, whether the facility is a Warehouse or Store.

1. This will open a `create facility page` where users can add the name of the facility and add internal IDs and external IDs of the facility. Finally, click on the `Create Facility` button.

4. On the next page, the user will get the option to add the facility address along with the exact geolocation of the facility. This geolocation helps in two ways:

* **Efficient Brokering:** At the time of order brokering, the brokering engine finds the nearest store from the customer’s location for fast delivery and lower shipping costs.
* **BOPIS Convenience:** Retailers can empower their customers to choose a pickup location or store by identifying the nearest store with the required product for their order.
  On Shopify PDP, customers choosing the "pickup today" option enter their current zip code to view a list of stores ranked from nearest to farthest.

Admin users can manually add the facility-associated latitude and longitude, or use the `Generate` icon to generate latitude and longitude based on the provided address automatically.
{% endhint %}

5. In the next step, users will get a configurations page from which users can specify the facility-specific configurations. Such as:

* **Product Store:** The user can specify the facilities available to fulfill the products of a certain brand.
* **Sell Inventory Online:** The User can configure whether the facility’s inventory should be available to sell on an e-commerce platform.
* **Allow Pickup:** User can configure whether the store is equipped to handle BOPIS operations.
* **Use Native Fulfillment App:** Finally, the user can specify whether the facility uses HotWax Commerce’s native Fulfillment app or third-party Fulfillment apps.
  For Warehouses employing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) for fulfillment, retailers can turn off the toggle, signifying that HotWax's fulfillment app is not being utilized.

If a facility uses the Native Fulfillment app then admin users would get the option to create a facility login that can be used by Facility staff.

6. Click `Save Configurations` to create the facility with the specified settings. Alternatively, users can choose to add configurations at a later time. Once facilities are added, users can manage and further modify these configurations within the Facilities App as needed.
