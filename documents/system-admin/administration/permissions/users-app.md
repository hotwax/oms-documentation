# Users App

The HotWax Commerce Users App is designed to manage user profiles and permissions within the system. Since all users are permitted to manage their own profiles, no specific permission is required to access the Users App for personal profile management. However, to add new users or to manage permissions specific to other users, additional higher-level permissions are required.

Below is a list of all the actions available in the Users App, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them.

### Users Tab
