# Vue Barcode Reader package

## Overview

The Vue Barcode Reader package is a Vue.js component library that enables the scanning and recognition of barcodes and QR codes. This package is used in HotWax Commerce apps to interpret the product's barcode and QR code and return its unique identifiers.

## Use Cases

### Case 1: Updating Physical Quantity in the Inventory Count App

During a cycle count, store staff needs to count the units of a product available in their store and update the inventory. The barcode reader package helps the user quickly scan the barcode and search for the product in the app to update inventory.

### Case 2: Receiving inventory in the Receiving App

When a store receives a shipment, store staff receives the inventory for the products. The barcode reader package allows store staff to scan the barcodes of the items in the shipment and quickly search for the scanned products in the app to receive them into the facility's inventory.

### Case 3: Picking Order Items in the Picking App

Store staff uses the picking app to pick up order items to prepare them for shipping carriers. By scanning the barcode, store staff can quickly search for the item in the app and mark it as picked, thereby checking it off the list.
