Runs in the brokering system act as containers for sequences of routings. These runs are scheduled by retailers to execute at specified intervals, allowing for effective and timely order routing.

## Viewing Brokering Runs

1. **Chronological Sequence**
   - Once logged in, you'll find all routing runs presented in a chronological sequence based on their next scheduled run time.

2. **Run Details**
   - Click on a specific run to open its details. Here, you can explore information about the run and find options to edit details such as its description.

## Scheduling Brokering Runs

Brokering runs are scheduled using two essential parameters:

1. **Frequency**
   - Determine how often you want the brokering run to execute. Options include:

2. **Runtime**
   - Specify the time of day (in 24-hour format) when the brokering run should initiate.

For example, setting the frequency of a run to "Daily" and the runtime to "7 am" will execute the brokering run every morning at 7 am.

Understanding how to view, schedule, and manage brokering runs is essential for optimizing your order routing strategies.

Now, let's explore routings within a run.
